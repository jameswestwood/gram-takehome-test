## Game Developer Take-Home Technical Test

### Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to review my code, this was a interesting task. All up it took me about 1 day.

Unfortunately I did not have time to tackle the bonus objectives due to external time constraints.

If you have any issues accessing / running my code please let me know.

### Feedback

I'd really appreciate any feedback and/or opinions on my approach to this task. Thanks!
